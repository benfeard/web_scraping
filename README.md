# Web Scraping Practice

I wanted to try reading data from a website and exploring HTML code with the BeautifulSoup library in Python.

In this excerise, I examine the headlines currently present on the [FiveThirtyEight](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com) website.

### Usage

Run the script and a list of headlines will print to your console window.

python webscraping_fivethirtyeight.py
